# verhaalsommen

This is a LateX project to create a series of math story exercises ("verhaalsommen")
for a Dutch student in the final year of elementary school ("groep 8").

The math story exercises can be created in bulk by using
- Claude Code
- a LateX structure that allows us to create the exercises in individual files, while
  still keeping exercise and solution separated in the final output file
- some tools that we instruct Claude Code to use:
  - 'calc' to verify calculations
  - 'genfilelist' to update the list of exercises to be included
